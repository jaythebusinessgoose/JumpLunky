# JumpLunky


Kaizo-like levels in Spelunky 2.

Currently includes 4 levels, with more in development. The 4 levels have the following themes:
- Dwelling (Enemy jumping)
- Volcana (Chain jumping)
- Temple (Crush trap puzzles)
- Sunken City (Buble wrap platforming)

Can you beat them all? Can you collect all of the golden idols?

## Version History
<br/>

### Version 1.4:
Added additional buttons to escape the  telescope.

Added a second telescope in the Temple level, at the top part of the puzzle.

### Version 1.3:

Added hardcore mode
- The player resets at the first level on every reset.
- Hardcore mode only available after all idols have been collected in the regular difficulty.

Added easy and hard difficulties
- Both difficulties have a similar layout, but add/remove/rearrange the traps to make some of the puzzles easier or much more difficult.
- Easy mode has mostly easier challenges that can still be tough for some players.
- Hard mode has the difficulty ramped up extremely.
- Hard mode only available after all idols have been collected in the regular difficulty.

Ana Spelunky makes her return, this time without crashing the game.

### Version 1.2:

Altered Temple slightly:
- Blocked off some misleading possibilities that cause confusion in parts of the puzzle that aren't supposed to be difficult, and don't help arrive at a solution.
- Blocked off (hopefuly) a way to cheese the final solution.

Sunken City:
- Fixed a couple of crashes.
- Removed a certain character that was causing a crash (hopefully temporary).
- Fixed a wall that was supposed to be too wide to bomb through.

### Version 1.1:

Made a couple of changes to the Dwelling and Sunken City:
- moved the Dwelling idol puzzle to post-exit and changed the puzzle, so that you can't use the idol to cheese the arrow traps.
- changed the way the sun challenge is activated to something I think is a bit cooler, and changed the outer rooms around it a bit to fit the new puzzle.
